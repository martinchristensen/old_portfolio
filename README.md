# My Personal website

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
It is my very first React App, and I learned as I went along, so I'm sure if I follow the conventions or have made this in the most optimal way or not 
(probably not). Anyway if you are looking for some example code to create your own personal website/portfolio feel free to 
take whatever you like, except my identity. But I would recommend you to look else where for best solutions since I can't guarantee anything.
This git is mainly to showcase how I made my website for my portfolio.
